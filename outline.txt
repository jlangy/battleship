build out elements

add functionality with document.ready.... onClick

So, need to figure out UI and click functions. 

Keep state in external object?

State = {
  GamePhase: {
    StartingGame:
      display options (vs AI, difficulty, colour, etc.)
    Placing ships:
      display ship selector, allow placement etc.
    P1 turn:
      click on square
    P2 turn (possibly AI)
      Choose square, play square
    Game end:
      static display screen, activate start button.
  }
  Board: {
    p1hitSquares: [...],
    p1missSquares: [...],
    p2hitSquares: [...],
    p2missSquares: [...],
    p1Ships: {destroyer: [...], etc.}
    p2Ships: {destroyer: [...], etc.}
  }
  GamePlay: {
    p1Turn: bool,
    p1Placing: bool,
    p2Placing: bool,
    p2Turn: bool,
    gamePhase: ? (str or num)
    currentShipOrientation(for placement phase): num (0 - 4)
  }
}

States:
  StratingGame:
    funcs:
    -displayStartButtons (pull up interface for phase)
    -onClicks for difficulty btns, AI vs human, colour?, start
  
  PlacingShips:
    -displayPlaceButtons (pull up interface for phase)
    -onClicks for each ship type
    -onKeyPress to reorient ships

  P1 turn:
    functions:
    -clickSquare
      -isClickable(square) (not already a hit/miss)
        -isHit(square)
          -drawHit(square)
            -sunkShip(square)
              -isEliminated(board.p1ships)
          -drawMiss(square)
